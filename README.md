# CNIT 279
This repo is for all of my personal answers and configs pertaining to the CNIT 279 class. 
## Usage
Please do not use these labs as your own, I answered all of these questions myself and to use this directly in your own lab would be considered plagiarism.

**That being said** please feel free to reference any questions, pinouts, diagrams, or reports that are in this repo. I made this project open source so that any prospective students can look at (hopefully correct) answers.

*I will try to go back and update questions that were incorrect.*
### Labs
The lab folder should be structred as follows:
- Lab #
  - report.pdf
  - *.pdf
  - *.md
  - Procedure #
    - main.c

Any included pdfs wre provided from class and represent the requirements for the lab. **main.c** contains my solution to any requirement to that part of lab.

## Prerequisites
