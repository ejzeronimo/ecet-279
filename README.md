# CNIT 372
This repo is for all of my personal answers and configs pertaining to the CNIT 372 class. 
## Usage
Please do not use these labs as your own, I answered all of these questions myself and to use this directly in your own lab would be considered plagiarism.

**That being said** please feel free to reference any questions or queries that are in this repo. I made this project open source so that any prospective students can look at (hopefully correct) answers.

*I will try to go back and update questions that were incorrect.*
### Labs
The lab folder should be structred as follows:
- Lab #
  - *.pdf
  - worksheet.sql

Any included pdfs wre provided from class and represent the requirements for the lab.  **Worksheet.sql** contains my answers to the questions provided by lab.

## Prerequisites
This assumes the use of an **Oracle SQL DB** and the use of some PL/SQL IDE like [sqldeveloper](https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/technologies/download/).

You can also use VS Code with the [Oracle Developer Tools for VS Code (SQL and PLSQL)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Oracle.oracledevtools) extension.

### Schema
The schema of the lab and all default data can be generated by running the *loadEagle.sql* file the root directory. The file generates tables according to the schema shown below.
